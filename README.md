# A document retrieval and summarization model for regulatory analysis.

Regulations are a form of law with some general rules made by persons to whom Parliament has delegated authority. In recent years the Canadian government has made its regulation public and discussed the problem they face in the regulations landscape. Every year regulations keep on updating, and organizations that do not comply with the governmentâ€™s regulations can end up paying billions of dollars in penalties. To make themselves compliant to regulations, organizations need to spend millions to third party companies to help them follow the rules.
To solve the above problem, we are trying to come up with a model that will extract regulations with their summaries relevant to a user's interest.

## How to execute this project??

 1. To clean the data run:
 ```bash
* preprocessing.ipynb
```
2. For model training run:
```bash
* training.ipynb
```
3. For model output run:
```bash
Inference_model.ipynb
```
